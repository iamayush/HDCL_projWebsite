        <h2>Upperbody Model and Pneumatic Controller for Easy Testing!</h2>
        <p>Powered  exoskeletons  have  potential  applications  in  aiding  manual  workers,  supporting  the  physically impaired  and  elders,  and  overall  reducing  the  risk  of  injury.  The  recent  developments  in  soft  pneumatic actuators have helped exoskeletons become lighter, safer and more dexterous.</p>
        <p>However, performance evaluation of exoskeleton designs has proven difficult. Most published studies test their  equipment  on  volunteers.  This  approach  makes  comparison  of  designs  unreliable  because  different volunteers can vary in weight and body shape. The volunteer-based testing is also inconvenient during the iterative development phase  when quick tests are  desired to compare small design changes. Lastly, tests can also be unsafe for human volunteers.</p>
        <p>Furthermore,  soft  pneumatic  actuators  are  only  recently  becoming  a  common  alternative  to  conventional actuators but off-the-shelf controllers for soft pneumatic actuators are not available. Thus, researchers must build  their  own  control  setups  to  use  pneumatic  actuators.  Building custom  controllers  can  discourage exoskeleton designers with limited knowledge of control systems and pneumatics.</p>
        <p>Hence,  there  is  a  clear  need  for a  test  bed  which  performs  reliable,  repeatable  and  safe  trials  of  different exoskeletons  and  provides  an  easy  user  interface  to  control  soft  pneumatic  actuators.  We  designed  and fabricated  an  upper-body  mannequin  modeled  from  published  anthropomorphic  data  for  50th  percentile American  male. We  also  built  a  pressure  controller  board  and  developed  software  for easy  control  of  soft pneumatic actuators. The mannequin has enabled exoskeleton designers at HDCL (Human Dynamics and Controls  Lab)  at  UIUC  to  test  their  designs  without  volunteers  and  therefore  perform  quick  tests,  ensure safety  and maintain  repeatability.  The  pressure  controller board  has  made using  soft  pneumatic  actuators easy  for  non-experts.  Designers  can  operate  pneumatic  actuators  at  different  pressures  and  speeds through  an  intuitive  software  interface.  This  document  serves  as  an  open-source  guide  for researchers interested in using our test bed for their respective exoskeleton projects. The document provides requisite mechanical  drawings,  software  files,  electrical  schematics  and  list  of  components  along  with  a  detailed procedure to build the mannequin and the controller board.</p>
